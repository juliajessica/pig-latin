# _Pig Latin Translator_

#### _Pig Latin Translator App for Epicodus_

#### By _**Julia Sheremet & Ryan G Ferris**_

## Description

_WebApp to translate English to Pig Latin._

## Specs

For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.

For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".

If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!

For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant.



_1. The program does nothing to non-alphabetical characters, since they do not contain consonants or vowels._

_2. The program adds "way" to single-letter words beginning with a vowel._

* _Example Input: t_
* _Example Output: tay_
_4. The program adds "way" to a multiple-word beginning with a vowel._
* _Example Input: The igloo is blue_
* _Example Output: The iglooway isway blue_
_5. The program adds "ay" to a multiple-word beginning **without** a vowel and moves multiple consonants that **don't** begin with a vowel to the end._
* _Example Input: The igloo is blue_
* _Example Output: ethay igloo is ueblay_
_6. The program recognizes vowels in a multiple-word sentence._
* _Example Input: The cat in the hat_
* _Example Output: 5: thE cAt In thE hAt_
_7. If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!_
